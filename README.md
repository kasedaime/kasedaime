- 👋 Hi, I’m @kasedaime
- 👀 I have a sweet spot for coding, tech and martial arts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Node, and trying to get better at my Angular and Spring game.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Angular and Java projects as well as other things as long as you give me an opportunity.
- 📫 I'm a very easy to deal with and I'm a straight forward guy so, if you want to do something crazy, original, share ideas or just need help, 
     I would be honored to help and share my ideas with you. Just email me at trapednstuck@gmail.com and let's make it happen.
